# Yodo

A simple Todo list manager created with React, Vite, and Firebase.

I followed the KISS protocol to keep the app simple and straightforward, avoiding unnecessary comments or code.

## Features

- Support for `English`, `Japanese` and `Portuguese`, defaulting to the browser's language
- Create, edit, and delete tasks
- Real-time sync with Firebase
- Minimalist UI
- E2E tests with Cypress

## Dev

First install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install

npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
